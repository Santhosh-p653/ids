📘 Project Log: Mobile IDs — Device Data Collector via ADB

🧩 Project Goal

To build a Mobile IDs system that can connect to multiple Android devices (real or virtual), collect kernel-level and system-level performance data, and store it for further analysis — forming the foundation for a mobile analytics or monitoring framework.


---

⚙ Setup Progress

✅ 1. ADB (Android Debug Bridge) Installation

Installed ADB platform tools manually (without Android Studio).

Extracted tools to:

C:\platform-tools

Verified ADB installation using:

adb version
adb devices

Confirmed that the phone connects via USB debugging and later through Wi-Fi (hotspot connection).



---

✅ 2. Device Connectivity Testing

Verified connection using:

adb devices

Start developer mode in mobile to access adb

Connected over both:

USB

Wi-Fi (via hotspot) using IP connection
Example:

adb tcpip 5555
adb connect 192.168.x.x:5555




---

⚠ 3. IP Retrieval Issue

Discovered that usb0 and rndis0 interfaces do not exist on newer phones.

Found actual network interface as:

swlan0 (IP: 192.168.23.28)

Confirmed hotspot-based ADB connection possible.



---

🧠 4. Batch Script for Automated Data Collection
File:windows.bat

Purpose:
> To automatically connect device over hotspot and manage connection 

File: collect_device.bat

Purpose:

> To automatically collect hardware, OS, and performance metrics from any connected Android phone and save them in a timestamped folder.



Main operations:

Detects first available ADB device.

Collects:

System properties → getprop.txt

CPU info → proc_cpuinfo.txt

Memory info → proc_meminfo.txt

Dumpsys memory report → dumpsys_meminfo.txt

Recent logs → logcat.txt

Screenshot → screen.png

Kernel logs (if accessible) → dmesg.txt



Output structure:

adb_collect_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
│
├── getprop.txt
├── proc_cpuinfo.txt
├── proc_meminfo.txt
├── dumpsys_meminfo.txt
├── logcat.txt
├── dmesg.txt
├── dmesg_err.txt (if dmesg blocked)
└── screen.png

🚫 5. dmesg Access Restriction

Command:

adb shell dmesg

→ returned Permission denied on non-rooted device.

Reason:

Modern Android (8+) blocks kernel ring buffer access for security.


Alternatives used/planned:

adb bugreport bugreport.zip → for kernel traces.

/proc/ and dumpsys → for safe stats.

adb logcat -b kernel → sometimes works on OEM builds.




---

🧩 6. Real-time Logs Exploration

Used:

adb logcat

→ entered continuous live log stream.

Exited safely using: Ctrl + C

Learned alternate modes:

Action	Command

Dump once & exit	adb logcat -d
Last 200 lines	adb logcat -t 200
Clear logs	adb logcat -c




---

🔜 Next Planned Steps

Goal	Description

1️⃣	Add more metrics: dumpsys cpuinfo, battery stats, network stats
2️⃣	Zip output folder for easy transfer
3️⃣	Create Python multi-device collector (auto-detect all devices)
4️⃣	Schedule periodic monitoring every few minutes
5️⃣	Integrate with a Flask backend for dashboard visualization
6️⃣	Optional: use Perfetto for kernel-level tracing (no root needed)



---

🧾 Current Files Created

File	Description

collect_device.bat	One-click data collector (Windows)
adb_collect_<timestamp>/	Folder containing all device logs and reports
(Planned) adb_multi_collect.py	Python version for multiple devices



---

🧰 Tools Used

ADB Platform Tools (adb, fastboot)

Command Prompt / PowerShell

Windows batch scripting

Android Developer Options (USB Debugging)



---

⚙ Device Access Modes Tested

Mode	Status

USB Debugging	✅ Working
Wi-Fi ADB (hotspot)	✅ Working
dmesg access	❌ Permission Denied
/proc filesystem	✅ Accessible
logcat (system logs)	✅ Working



---

📍 Current Status:

✅ Base ADB setup and collector working
⚙ Preparing for kernel-level and performance metric extension
🧩 Next step: integrate multi-device collection + periodic data logging

Summary:


* 05/11/25
THE PROJECT MOBILE INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM  HAS BEEN STARTED AND DEVELEOPED THE ENVIRONMENT TO CHECK THE MOBILE PERFORMANCE AND MAKE CONNECTIONS BEFORE DIVING INTO EXCAT BREAKING OF SYSTEMS .
STEP1: RECONNAISANCE COLLECT  THE NECESSARY DETAILS ABOUT THE DEVICE HAS BEEEN EXECUTED
STEP 2: THE ENVIRONMENT ADB IS INSTALLED VIA CLI USING FEW COMMANDS AND THE COMMANDS MENTIONED IN THE ABOVE FILE
STEP3:START THE DEVELOPER MODE TO CONNECT THE DEVICE
STEP 4:CONNECT  VIA USB AND WRITTEN WINDOWS.BAT TOAUTOMATE CONNECTION WITHOUT A USB CABLE
STEP 5: PERFORM A SAMPLE TEST ON CAPTURING SCREENSHOT OF DEVICE  FROM THE HOST SYSTEM
STEP 6:TRIED TO ACCESS THE MOBILE LOGS ACCESS PERMISSION AND BECESSARY DETAILS AND STORED IN A FOLDER BY WRITING BAT SCRIPT
STEP7:PERFORMED ADBLOGCAT COMMAND TO ANALYZE THE SYSTEM LOGS
STEP8: IDENTIFIED CPU PERFORMANCE AND SCHEDULING
