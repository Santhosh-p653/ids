PROJECT LOG: MOBILE IDS 

CREATE A METRICS.PY
PURPOSE: To collect the info about cpu processes,memory utilization of device,battery consumption,sensor states and details,system logs to train the model
PROCESS:The python script helps to create a csv filenamed metrics.csv to store the device logs .This data will be  scrubbed ,
extracting feautures which are required the table will be  converted to two dimensional matrix for convenience and clean the missing values by row compression techniques.
There will be a tradeoff between models performance and missing data 
AIM:
 To convert the dataset into useful data and can be synthesized with mean,median,modes to cover up the  missing values
 One hot encoding will be performed to convert the data as nuerical for classsification friendly
 Binning is another category of feauture engineering useful to convert numerical data to categorical data
 How much data do I need?
  May be 1000,2000,10000,or even more
NEXT STEPS TO BE PERFORMED ON FOLLOWING DAYS:
#SCHEMA MATCHING
#DATA STANDARDIZATION
#DATA PROFILING
#SIMILARITY JOINS
#PARSING
#ONE HOT ENCODING
#BINNNING
#BAGGING
SUMMARY:
1.Collected a minimal amount of dataset by using thsi scripts. 
2.Created a github repo for version control and collaborative workflow
3.Defined a project structure
4.Installation of openjdk package for java 
5.Push the needed scripts to github for the future proof works
